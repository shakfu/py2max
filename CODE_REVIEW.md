# Repository Code Review

## Findings

No outstanding issues.

## Feature Suggestions

1. Auto-populate object metadata (inlets/outlets/types, default rectangles) from `maxref` during box creation and expose a refresh command for legacy patches.

2. Implement the `py2max` console entry point advertised in `pyproject.toml` to streamline CLI-driven patch generation and validation.

3. Add a layout preview command (e.g., `make layout-preview`) that renders PNG/SVG snapshots, helping contributors evaluate new layout strategies without opening Max.
